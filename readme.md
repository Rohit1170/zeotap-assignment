# Zeotap Assignment
### This repository contains two assignments:
## Application 1 : Rule Engine with AST 
This is a simple 3-tier rule engine application comprising a UI, API, and Backend. The purpose of the system is to evaluate user eligibility based on attributes such as age, department, income, and spending. The rule engine employs an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) to represent conditional rules, enabling dynamic creation, combination, and modification of these rules.
## Application 2 : Real-Time Data Processing System for Weather Monitoring with Rollups and Aggregates
This application is designed as a real-time data processing system for monitoring weather conditions and generating summarized insights through rollups and aggregates. The system leverages data from the OpenWeatherMap API.
